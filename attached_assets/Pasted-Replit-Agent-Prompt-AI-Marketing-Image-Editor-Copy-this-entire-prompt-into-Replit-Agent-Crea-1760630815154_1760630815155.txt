BACK-END LOGIC

File Upload Integration

Use Replit's Google Drive Connector:

Upload PDF Brief:

JavaScript


// Upload to Google Drive folder: "Instructions2"
const pdfUpload = await googleDrive.upload({
  file: pdfFile,
  folderId: '1oBX3lAfZQq9gt4fMhBe7JBh7aKo-k697',
  name: `brief-${Date.now()}.pdf`
});


Upload Product Images:

JavaScript


// Upload to Google Drive folder: "Product Images"
for (const image of imageFiles) {
  await googleDrive.upload({
    file: image,
    folderId: '1_WUvTwPrw8DNpns9wB36cxQ13RamCvAS',
    name: image.name
  });
}


Processing Status Polling

After uploads complete, poll for results:

JavaScript


// Poll Google Drive for "New Images" folder
// This folder is created by the n8n workflow when processing completes
const pollInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  try {
    const newImagesFolder = await googleDrive.listFiles({
      folderId: 'NEW_IMAGES_FOLDER_ID', // Get this from Google Drive
      orderBy: 'modifiedTime desc'
    });
    
    if (newImagesFolder.files.length >= expectedImageCount) {
      clearInterval(pollInterval);
      displayResults(newImagesFolder.files);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Polling error:', error);
  }
}, 5000); // Check every 5 seconds
