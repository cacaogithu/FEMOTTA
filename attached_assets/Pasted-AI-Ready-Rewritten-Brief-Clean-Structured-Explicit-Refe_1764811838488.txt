Technical Notes for the AI Model
Maintain consistent color grading across the entire set.
Keep text minimal, modern, and high-contrast for readability.
Avoid over-editing; preserve authenticity of the hardware.
Keep all logos vector-sharp; do not distort or stretch.
Output PSDs with organized named layers (Text / Product / Logos / Background / Effects).
